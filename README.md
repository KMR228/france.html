    <h1>France</h1>


        <p>France today is one of the most modern countries in the world and is a
        leader among European nations. It plays an influential global role as a
        permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, NATO, the G-7,
        the G-20, the EU, and other multilateral organizations. <p/>

        <p>France rejoined NATO's integrated military command structure in 2009,
        reversing DE GAULLE's 1966 decision to withdraw French forces from NATO.
        Since 1958, it has constructed a hybrid presidential-parliamentary governing
        system resistant to the instabilities experienced in earlier, more purely
        parliamentary administrations. <p/>

        <p>In recent decades, its reconciliation and cooperation with Germany have
        proved central to the economic integration of Europe, including the introduction
        of a common currency, the euro, in January 1999. In the early 21st century,
        five French overseas entities - French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte,
        and Reunion - became French regions and were made part of France proper. <p/>
